### Pablo Andr√©s Andalaft Tarodo

I am an Aerospace Engineer turned coder. I am at [42 Wolfsburg](https://www.42wolfsburg.de) to develop fully into a Software Engineer.

### Software Background 

I have used the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) together with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to bring websites to life. At work, I've developed Google Scripts that use ***JavaScript***. During my Aerospace studies I used [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) and ***C*** for applied Engineering. At 42 I am mostly coding with ***C***/***C++***.
